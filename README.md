# ML-100-Intoduction-To-Data Science-and-Machine-Learning

This repo consolidates material for the [ML-100-Intoduction-To-Data Science-and-Machine-Learning](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Data-Science-and-Data-Engineering/) training program.

## Topics Covered

[Pre-requisites](week0).
Covers pre-requisites for the course.

1. [Python for Data Science](week1).
Gets us familiar with **Python**, so we can use it for Data Science and Machine Learning.

2. [Machine Learning Foundations](week2).
Will covers core **Concepts** used in Machine Learning.

3. [Linear Classifiers](week3).
Implement **Linear Regression** from scratch. Explore how the sample ideas extend to other linear classifiers (**Logistic Regression**, **SVM**) etc.

4. [Decision Trees](week4).
Understand tree-based algorithms. Use a popular ML toolkit [**scikit-learn**] on real-world dataset using **Decision Trees**.

5. [Advanced Topics](week5).
Other evaluation **Metrics** (e.g. AUC), Bias / Variance, **Deep Learning**, ML as a service, **A/B** flights. Other popular ML libraries (e.g. **TensorFlow**)

6. [Project](week6).
Guidance for real-world projects using ML.
